      <p>My family is pretty awesome (to me anyway). They are 
        so much fun and bring me a lot of happiness. I love spending
        time with them and making memories. We are all very 
        different, but we all support eachother and help eachother
        be our best! Here is a little more about each of them.

          <p>Travis was born in St. Louis, MO and he grew up in 
          Alton, IL. He attended Alton High and played football and
          wrestled. He has 3 sisters and 1 brother. He is the oldest. 
          As a teenager he attended Greater Alton Church which 
          planted The Crossings Church in Wentzville, MO.</p>
          <p>Travis moved to Wentzville for the church plant in 2007, 
          when I met him at Lindenwood University. We were married in 2009. 
          August 8, 2019 will be our 10 year anniversary!

          <p>Ayven Asher was born on September 30, 2017 at Missouri Baptist
            Hospital. She was 8 lbs. 1 oz. and 21.5 inches. She has 
            curly blonde hair and long eyelashes like her sister. 
            We call her Avie.
          </p>
          <p>Avie loves to talk, play, and hang out with Lyla. Lyla
            has taught her so much, she reads with her and teaches her new words. Avie is adventurous and loves
            to explore things. She also has several food allergies, 
            which has been a new adjustment for us, but she handles
            it so well!
